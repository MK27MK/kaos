# TODOS

- make solid data loading system with naming conventions
- create plotting with realtime compatibility without desrupting nautilus
- ...

## notes

- non mi piace come in test-kit/providers.py si usi `first_friday_two_years_six_months_ago` \
  nel calcolo dell'activation date dei futures, potenzialmente impreciso.

## questions

- https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/backtesting

  The platform converts each bar's OHLC prices into a sequence of market updates.
  These updates always follow the same order: Open → High → Low → Close.
  If you provide multiple timeframes (like both 1-minute and 5-minute bars), the platform uses the more granular data for highest accuracy.

  **question**: so if I provide 1min and 1hr data, the latter is going to have \ 60 intrabar states before being complete?

- if current candle hits my limit order is it going to be triggered
  at the limit price or at the closing price of the candle that hits it?

- what's going to happen if I resample a timeframe with missing timestamps /
  to a higher timeframe?
